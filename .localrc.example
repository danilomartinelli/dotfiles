# The bootstrap script will automatically create a copy of this file
# as .localrc and symlink it to ~/.localrc
#
# WARNING: Never commit .localrc with sensitive data to version control!
# This file should contain sensitive information like API keys and passwords.
#
# Setup (handled by bootstrap):
#   1. Copies .localrc.example → .localrc
#   2. Creates symlink .localrc → ~/.localrc
#   3. Sets proper permissions (600)
#
# Manual editing after bootstrap:
#   vim ~/.dotfiles/.localrc  # or vim ~/.localrc (both work with symlink)
#
# After editing, reload your shell:
#   source ~/.zshrc
#   # or use the alias: reload!
#
#
# WARNING: Below are environment variables that we are using for some of our setups.
# If you are using this file as a template, make sure to replace these with your own.

export MORPH_API_KEY="<CHANGE_ME>"
export TAVILY_API_KEY="<CHANGE_ME>"

# ========================================
# NOTE: Best Practices for Managing Secrets
# ========================================
#
# 1. Remember to keep this file secure with proper permissions:
#    chmod 600 ~/.localrc
#
# 2. Never commit this file to version control
#
# 3. Consider using a password manager (like Bitwarden) to store
#    these secrets securely and generate strong passwords
#
# 4. Rotate your secrets regularly
#
# 5. Use different credentials for development and production
#
# 6. Some services provide scoped tokens - use the minimum required permissions
